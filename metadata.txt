about=MitiConnect integrates ecological connecitivy in mitigation hierarchy based on landscape graphs. Using Graphab tool and its dedicated QGIS plugin graphab4qgis, MitiConnect eases the definition of mitigation scenarios through its user-friendly interface. User can prepare data, define target species ecological parameters such as dispersal capacities, creates new scenarios by stacking landuse modifications, and manages all treatments from MitiConnect interface.
 MitiConnect has been developped by Mathieu Chailloux based on Simon Tarabon (Ubiquiste) thesis work on an original idea from Jennifer Amsallem (INRAE). Work has been funded by the French ecological network resource center and French ministry of ecology.
