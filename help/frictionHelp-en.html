    To each land use class and subnetwork is associated a numeric value (no value means that matching class is ignored).<br/>
    This value represents the effective resistance of matching habitat to matching subnetwork species dispersal.<br/>
    Coefficients can be imported from and exported to a CSV file. Please ensure such CSV file uses semi-comma ';' as seperator and encoding UTF-8.<br/>
    Absolute value of coeffcients is not essential. What does matter is the proportionality ratio between favorability classes.<br/>
